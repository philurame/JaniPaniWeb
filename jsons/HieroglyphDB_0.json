It's important to imagine your version of Jourm as very big, because it will help us to differentiate him from Jo-Anne, who is the character associated with the similar, but shorter reading (and character) じょ.

Do make sure you take this story to a ridiculous enough level to hook a memory into that brain of yours. Be mad at him for not following construction site regulations (where's his shirt, shoes, and pants!?). Why is he using that bulldozer like that? Alternatively, say you really do like what you see (you're going to have to imagine a much better looking version of こういち's actual face, though). You and こういち make eye contact a little too long. He nods, puts his cigarette out, and takes off his hard hat, letting his long Fabio-esque locks flow. You beckon him over and he comes. What happens next is up to you and your own imagination.

He takes one barb, and connects the end of it to the top of another barb. When he does this, he knows his work is finally finished.

One... two... three... *YAWN* ... four. There, you did it. But *yawn* now you can't stop yawning. You're so, so sleepy. Four is too high a number to count without falling asleep. By the way! Both the reading よん and し are pretty common, but because the on'yomi reading し sounds just like the word for \"death,\" it isn't used as much. Generally when you're just counting (for example, \"1, 2, 3, 4...\"), you will use the reading し. But when you are counting things or people, you'll use よん.

There’s just too much hair! To get rid of it, you’ll need to mow (もう) it down with a lawn mower. Imagine yourself starting up the lawn mower, and taking it around, mowing down the hair. Hear the sound of the mower in your head (they’re loud and distinct). The important thing is to imagine yourself mowing everything. Key is to think “fur → In the fur → getting rid of the fur → mow the fur,” in that order. That’ll get you to mow, which will help you to remember the on’yomi. Smell the fur as you mow it down. Feel it flying everywhere. It's giant, so it must be pretty intense. Make it more intense to help yourself to remember the reading of this kanji better."
