        "reading": "Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it uses the kun'yomi reading. 間 has two common kun'yomi readings, あいだ and ま. You haven't learned these readings yet, so here's an explanation of each reading and mnemonics to help you remember them:  When 間 refers to a longer interval of time, it's generally read as あいだ. For a short burst of time, it's read as ま. When it means an interval of space, it's usually read as あいだ.  You can remember this because time feels longer in Idaho (あいだ). Any interval of time you spend there feels so long, because Idaho life moves so slowly. As soon as you cross the border and enter a new state, you call your ma (ま) to tell her you're finally out of that slooooow state, and the intervals of time feel shorter."
