Digging with nothing but a spoon takes a long time, especially when the hole needs to be big enough for a coffin. You might as well be digging it for yourself at this rate. By the time you finish, you’ll be all wrinkled and elderly and just about ready to keel over. Imagine yourself digging a coffin hole with nothing but a spoon. Your hands get all cramped, your wrist starts to hurt, and you get painful blisters on your hands. It takes forever to dig a hole big enough for a coffin!",
        "reading": "Now that you’re elderly (and probably about to die) you suddenly crave some delicious roe (ろう). Salmon roe, sea urchin roe, tofugu roe, doesn’t matter. Your old, tired bones need roe after all that hard work! You hated roe when you were still young, but now that you’re an elderly old fart you really want to eat it. Roe is for old people, you guess, as you slurp it up."

It’s a tsunami rodeo and this crazy sheep is riding that tsunami wave in classic Western style.  This kanji also means ocean, because presumably the people from the \"West\" who have \"Western Style\" came from across the ocean. They're the \"Ocean People\" in this sense. You'll want to be familiar with this meaning for vocab later on. Imagine how ridiculous a sheep would look all decked out in Western style cowboy gear. Now imagine it riding a tsunami wave as it screams, “Baa~ baa~ baa~!”",
        "reading": "After a whole day of riding this tsunami, the sheep is hankerin’ for some Western style food. This sheep loves yogurt (よう). And its favorite flavor is Western style apple pie yogurt. America loves its apple pie and this sheep loves Western style apple pie flavored yogurt. Imagine yourself eating this Western style apple pie yogurt. It tastes just like apple pie only creamier and fruitier. Taste the sweet yogurt in your mouth as you imagine yourself scarfing some down."

When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: You're holding onto a sports ball in your hand, let's say it's a baseball for this mnemonic's sake. You throw it at your friend who's going to catch it. As it flies through the air, though, it transforms into a tomahawk (たま). Imagine your shock and fear as you see this happening, flying towards your friend! It's going to stick in his forehead. He can't catch this with his glove!  Also notice that it has the same reading as the vocab word 玉. So, if you know that one, you may know this one too! They're kind of similar. This can be read きゅう too, if you're talking about more of a globe sphere than the ball sphere you throw."
